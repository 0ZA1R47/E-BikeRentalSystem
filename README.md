# E-Bike Rental System
I build this web-based application for my Database Systems Course semester project.  
- It has an ADMIN interface to Create Update and, Delete E-bike records. 
- It  has an admin-authentication feature for ADMIN Interface.
- It has an User Interface that allows user to register account or sign-in and order an E-bike from nearest station. 
- It has an user-authentication feature for USER interface.

## NOTE:
This repo only contains the ADMIN interface/Panel of the application. The User Interface code will be uploaded later. Also, it is just a prototype.

## Tech Stack:
- ASP.NET
- C# 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MySQL Database
