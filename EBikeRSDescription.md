## Software Requirements

A group of Cyber security students have chosen their final year project named E-Bike Rental System. They want to design a web-based application which would enable users to book/rent E-bikes on hourly or daily basis. This service will be initially available in Islamabad on test and trial basis. The application requires a database at back-end for smooth function and a front end GUI.

E-bikes will be available on designated places like main markets, bus stands and metro stations etc.

## System Requirements/functionality: 

· MySQL database to manage data i.e. user, ride, booking, bike.

· Front-end website with GUI.

· Hosting service since it’s a web-based application.

· Google maps for live location of customer and E-bike.

· Live tracking of E-Bike through trackers installed on each bike.

· Daily customers will get different incentives i.e. discount coupons, free hours.

· Customer will be charged on distance travelled or hourly basis as per his selection.

· Peak-factor will applied if demand is greater than supply at that moment in the particular area.

· If customer exceeds booking time then he will be charged on every extra 10 minutes.

## User Requirements/Expectation:

· Device with internet to access web-based platform.

· A fully operational website for renting an E-bike.

· Customer will rent E-bike available to him at nearest location.

· He will choose between hourly rent or miles traveled.

· He will get ride/booking, bike details and pin location of nearest E-bike.

Each bike can be rented by a single customer at a time.

## User and System Reports:

· For each customer, a report showing an overview of rides booked. 

· For system admin, different reports showing E-bike service history, maintenance record, incident/loss reports.
